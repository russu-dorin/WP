# Windows Programming

student gr. FAF-111: Russu Dorin

# Topic: WIN32 API programming basics

## Intro
### Purpose
* Event-driven programming (message-oriented)
* API
* Windows applications development
### Additional Purposes
* Version Control Systems (GIT)
* Programming Style Guidelines
* Debugging
* Testing

## Completed Mandatory Objectives
* Create a Windows application
* Choose Programming Style Guidelines that you'll follow
* Add 2 buttons to window: one with default styles, one with custom styles (size, background, text color, font family, font size)
* Add 2 text inputs to window: one with default styles, one with custom styles (size, background, text color, font family, font size)
* Add 2 text elements to window: one with default styles, one with custom styles (size, background, text color, font family, font size)

## Completed Objectives With Points
* Make elements to fit window on resize (1 pt)
* Make elements to interact or change other elements (1 pt for 2 different interactions) (0-2 pt)
* Change behavior of different window actions (at least 3) (1pt)

## The Application Creation Steps
To make this laboratory work I have read the recommended chapter (some less chapter 9), used msdn, StackOverflow and of course, lots of google searches.
My application is a simple window which offers you the possibility of viewing some random text in a box after pressing buttons.
* 5 buttons (Random text output, 2 simple outputs, dim button, close button)
* 4 fields for output of the text
* Background color changed
* No resize handler
* Text with different style

About PSG used: it is C Style, with 2 exceptions, which I introduce for a better visualisation of large codes.
* Text comments (usually before the commented line and after a free line, but with exceptions of commenting large number of lines, where it is done directly in the line)
* While writing the arguments of a function with lots of them, I write them from the new line, each, with same tabulation)

## Outro

Though it was pretty unusual to write this kind of programs, understanding the principle of work and finding some functionalities on net; it was interesting to see how actually Windows works. What I enjoyed most about this lab was to put in practice some theory about Event-Driven Programming. During this work, I learned more about Win API, perfected my time management (cause this time I failed =) ), enjoyed time making cool stuff. 
In a nutshell, I gained more experience and learned how to apply Win API knowledge.
